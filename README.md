# Info & List of Components  (WIP)

### Why a list and not one big repo containing tons of components? 

After much reading and working with components, seems the ideal path of components is for each have their own repo. Imagine you're working on a project. That project will have it's own repo but that repo can have [Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). In that way, each component can be independently worked on, shared / used in other projects, etc and contributed back to -- or could fork a component to repurpose for another project. Not absolutely every component needs to have a repo of course. You can have a component that handles something so specific to a particular project, no one including yourself will ever want or need it again -- or if there's already one you pulled from to get a jumping off point and it be confusing and/or pointless to have two of nearly the same thing. For everything else however, best to just have a repo for it.
